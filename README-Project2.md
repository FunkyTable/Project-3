# Project 2 - Maple Homes

## Overview
1. This is GitHub repository represents the final project submission for Greg Osborne's second project at FlatIron school. The project assignment was to analyze a selected set of data for recommendations to present to a real estate company, Maple Homes.
## Business Understanding
1. Maple Homes is moving in to King County and wants to provide good business recommendations to their employees to help them use their time wisely.
2. I made business recommendations based on the following three variables:
      * Waterfront?
      * Grade Rating?
      * Year Built?
## Data Understanding and Analysis
1. Source of data
      * All data used in this project was from King County. It is a database full of various statistics regarding home sales in the county. 
3. Visualizations
  Three visualizations (the same visualizations presented in the slides and notebook)
    * ![Bathroom Curve](Visualizations/Bathrooms%20Curve.png)
    * ![Grade Curve](Visualizations/Grade%20Curve.png)
    * ![Year Curve](Visualizations/Year%20Curve.png)
  Seven graphics exclusively for aesthetics in the Google Slides doc.

    * ![Commission](Visualizations/Commission.jpg)
    * ![Growth](Visualizations/Growth.png)
    * ![High Grade](Visualizations/High%20Grade.jpg)
    * ![KingCounty](Visualizations/KingCounty.jpg)
    * ![Questionmark](Visualizations/Questionmark.jpg)
    * ![Scatterplot](Visualizations/Scatterplot.png)
    * ![Waterfront](Visualizations/Waterfront.jpg)

    
    
## Conclusion
* This analysis is limited by time and budget. There are many other factors to consider when trying to sell homes. The three recommendations I make are:
    1. High grade is the best indicator of a high sale price.
      * Grade data is readily available on the King County website.
      * Salesmen should search for homes listed as high grades and offer their services to those homeowners.
      * Information on the grade scale is provided in the appendix of this presentation.
    2. More bathrooms translates to a higher sales price.
      * The average number of bathrooms in homes for King County is two.
      * Salesmen should, again search for homes with a higher than average number of bathrooms and offer the homeowners their services.
    3. The one hundred and forty six homes on the waterfront will each sell for a high price. 
      * A home on the waterfront sells for $844K more than the same home in another area.
      * These homes’ average sale price is $1,717,215.
      * Salesmen should make long term goals to represent one of these homes.
